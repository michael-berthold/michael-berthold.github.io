Welcome to my personal website! This is the first post on my new blog where I'll be sharing articles, thoughts, and reflections on various topics.

## What's Coming

Over the coming weeks and months, I'll be adding:

- Detailed **About Me** information in both English and German
- A collection of my **presentations and videos**
- My **publications** across different categories
- Regular **musings** on technology, innovation, and more

## Stay Tuned
